<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>RIOTS OF LONDON.</h3>
<p>Seventy years having passed away since the riots of London,
there cannot be many living who remember them, and still fewer who
were personally in contact with the tumultuous throng. Under such
circumstances, I venture to offer for introduction into your useful
and entertaining miscellany some incidents connected with that
event in which I was either personally an actor or
spectator&mdash;things not in themselves important, yet which may
be to some of your readers acceptable and interesting as records of
bygone days.</p>
<p>The events of 1780, in themselves so terrific, were well adapted
to be written indelibly on the memory of a young, and ardent boy.
At any age they would have been engraved as with an iron pen; but
their occurrence at the first age of my early boyhood, when no
previous event had claimed particular attention, fixed them as a
lasting memorial.</p>
<p>The awful conflagrations had not taken place when I arrived in
London from a large school in one of the midland counties in
England, for the Midsummer vacation. So many of my school-fellows
resided in the metropolis, or in a part of the country requiring a
passage through London, that three or four closely-packed
post-chaises were necessary; and to accomplish the journey in good
time for the youngsters to be met by their friends, the journey was
begun as near to four o'clock A.M. as was possible.</p>
<p>The chaises, well crowned with boxes, and filled with joyous
youth, were received at the Castle and Falcon, then kept by a Mr.
Dupont, a celebrated wine merchant, and the friend of our estimable
tutor. The whole of my schoolmates had been met by their respective
friends, and my brother and I alone remained at the inn, when at
length my mother arrived in a hackney-coach to fetch us, and from
her we learned that the streets were so crowded that she could
hardly make her way to us. No time was lost, and we were soon on
our way homewards. We passed through Newgate Street and the Old
Bailey without interruption or delay; but when we came into Ludgate
Hill the case was far different; the street was full and the people
noisy, permitting no carriage to pass unless the coachman took off
his hat and acknowledged his respect for them and the object for
which they had congregated. "Hat off, coachee!" was their cry. Our
coachman would not obey their noisy calls, and there we were fixed.
Long might we have remained in that unpleasant predicament had not
my foreseeing parent sagaciously provided herself with a piece of
ribbon of the popular colour, which she used to good effect by
making it up into a bow with a long, streamer and pinning it to a
white handkerchief, which she courageously flourished out of the
window of the hackney-coach. Huzzas <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page274" id="page274"></a>{274}</span> and "Go on, coachee!" were
shouted from the crowd and with no other obstruction than the full
streets presented, we reached Beaufort Buildings, in the Strand,
the street in which we resided.</p>
<p>There a new scene presented itself, which was very impressive to
our young minds. The street was full of soldiers, and the coachman
said to my mother, "I cannot go down." A soldier addressed my
mother: "No one, ma'am, can go down this street:" to whom my mother
replied, "I live here, and am going to my own home." An officer
then gave permission for us, and the coachman with our box, to
proceed, and we were soon at our own door. The coachman, ignorant
of the passport which the handkerchief and ribbon had proved, said,
on setting the box down, "You see, ma'am, we got on without my
taking off my hat: for who would take off his hat to such a set of
fellows? I would rather have sat there all the day long."</p>
<p>The assembling of the military in this street was to defend the
dwellings of Mr. Kitchener and Mr. Heron, both these gentlemen
being Roman Catholics. Mr. Kitchener (who was the father of Dr.
Kitchener, the author of the <i>Cook's Oracle</i>) was an eminent
coal merchant, whose wharf was by the river-side southward, behind
Beaufort Buildings, then called Worcester Grounds<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, as the lane leading to it was called
Worcester Lane: but Mr. Kitchener, or his successor Mr. Cox,
endeavoured to change it by having "Beaufort Wharf" painted on
their wagons. Thus the name "Worcester Grounds" got lost; but the
lane which bore the same name got no advantage by the change, for
it received the appropriate title of "Dirty Lane," used only for
carts and horses, foot passengers reaching the wharf by the steps
at the bottom of Fountain Court and Beaufort Buildings.</p>
<p>But to return to my narrative. My parents soon removed us out of
this scene of public confusion, to the house of a relative residing
at St. Pancras: and well do I remember the painful interest with
which, as soon as it got dark, the whole family of my uncle used to
go on the roof of the house and count the number of fires, guessing
the place of each. The alarm was so great, though at a distance,
that it was always late before the family retired to rest. I
remained at St. Pancras until the riots had been subdued and peace
restored; and now, though very many matters crowd my mind, as
report after report then reached us, I will leave them to record
only what I personally saw and heard.</p>
<p>Before the vacation was ended, the trials of the prisoners had
proceeded, and I went to a friend's house to see some condemned
ones pass to execution. The house from which I had this painful
view has been removed; the site is now the road to Waterloo Bridge.
I believe it was because a lad was to be executed that I was
allowed to go. The mournful procession passed up St. Catherine's
Street, and from the distance I was, I could only see that the lad
in height did not reach above the shoulders of the two men between
whom he sat, who, with him, were to be executed in Russell Street.
Universal and deep was the sympathy expressed towards the youth
from the throng of people, which was considerable. As it was long
before the street was sufficiently cleared to allow us to return
home, the report came that the execution was over, and that the boy
was so light that the executioner jumped on him to break his neck:
and such was the effect of previous sympathy, that a feeling of
horror was excited at the brutality (as they called it) of the
action; but, viewing it calmly, it was wise, and intended kindly to
shorten the time of suffering. While thus waiting, I heard an
account of this boy's trial. A censure was expressed on the
government for hanging one so young, when it was stated that this
boy was the only one executed, though so many were guilty, as an
example, as the proof of his guilt was unquestionable. A witness
against him on the trial said, "I will swear that I have seen that
boy actively engaged at several conflagrations." He was rebuked for
thus positively speaking by the opposite counsel, when he said, "I
am quite sure it is the active boy I have seen so often for I was
so impressed with his flagrant conduct that I cut a piece out of
his clothes:" and putting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out
the piece which he had cut off, which exactly fitted to the boy's
jacket. This decided his execution: yet justice was not vindictive,
for very few persons were executed.</p>
<p>I will trespass yet further on your pages to recite one other
incident of the riots that occurred in connexion with the attack on
the King's Bench prison, and the death of Allen, which made a great
stir at the time. The incident I refer to happened thus:&mdash;At
the gate of the prison two sentinels were placed. One of these was
a fine-built young man, full six feet high: he had been servant to
my father. On the day Allen was shot, or a day or two after, he
came to my father for protection: my father having a high opinion
of his veracity and moral goodness, took him in and sheltered him
until quiet was restored. His name was M'Phin, or some such name;
but as he was always called "Mac" by us, I do not remember his name
perfectly. He stated that he and his fellow-soldier, while standing
as sentries at the prison, were attacked by an uproarious mob, and
were assailed with stones and brickbats;&mdash;that his companion
called loudly to the mob, and said, "I will not fire until I see
and mark a man that throws at us, and then he shall die. I don't
want to kill the innocent, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"
id="page275"></a>{275}</span> or any one; but he that flings at us
shall surely die." Young Allen threw a brick-bat, and ran off; but
Mac said, his fellow-soldier had seen it, and marked him. The crowd
gave way; off went Allen and the soldier after him. Young Allen ran
on, the soldier pursuing him, till he entered his father's
premises, who was a cow-keeper, and <i>there</i> the soldier shot
him. Popular fury turned upon poor Mac; and so completely was he
thought to be the "murderer" of young Allen that 500<i>l.</i> was
offered by the mob for his discovery. But my good father was
faithful to honest Mac, and he lay secure in one of our upper rooms
until the excitement was over.</p>
<p>Allen's funeral was attended by myriads, and a monument was
erected to his memory (which yet remains, I believe) in Newington
churchyard, speaking lies in the face of the sun. If it were
important enough, it deserves erasure as much as the false
inscription on London's monument.</p>
<p>As soon as the public blood was cool, "Mac" surrendered himself,
was tried at the Old Bailey, and acquitted.</p>
<p>Should it be in the power of any of the readers of your
interesting miscellany, by reference to the Session Papers, to give
me the actual name of poor "Mac," I shall feel obliged.</p>

<h3>SATIRICAL POEMS ON WILLIAM III.</h3>
<p>Some years since I copied from a MS. vol., compiled before 1708,
the following effusions of a Jacobite poet, who seems to have been
"a good hater" of King William. I have made ineffectual efforts to
discover the witty author, or to ascertain if these compositions
have ever been printed. My friend, in whose waste-book I found
them,&mdash;a beneficed clergyman in Worcestershire, who has been
several years dead,&mdash;obtained them from a college friend
during the last century.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"UPON KING WILLIAM'S TWO FIRST CAMPAGNES.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S GRIEF AND FRENZY.</h3>
<p>I have looked into many an edition of Shakspeare, but I have not
found one that traced the connexion that I fancy exists between the
lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cassius.</i> "I did not think you could have been so
angry."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Brutus.</i> "O Cassius! I am sick of many griefs."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or between</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Brutus.</i> "No man bears sorrow better.&mdash;Portia is
dead."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cassius.</i> "How 'scaped I killing when I crossed you
so!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, Act iv. Sc. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which will perhaps better suit the object that I have in view.
The editors whose notes I have examined probably thought the
connexion so self-evident or insignificant as not to require either
notice or explanation. If so, I differ from them, and I therefore
offer the following remarks for the <i>amusement</i> rather than
for the <i>instruction</i> of those who, like myself, are not at
all ashamed to confess that they cannot read Shakspeare's music
"<i>at sight</i>." I believe that both <i>Replies</i> contain an
allusion to the fact that <i>Anger, grafted on sorrow, almost
invariably assumes the form of frenzy; that it is in every sense of
the word "Madness," when the mind is unhinged, and reason, as it
were, totters from the effects of grief</i>.</p>
<p>Cassius had but just mildly rebuked Brutus for making no better
use of his philosophy, and now&mdash;startled by the sudden sight
of his bleeding, mangled heart&mdash;"Portia is&mdash;Dead!" pays
involuntary homage to the very philosophy he had so rashly
underrated by the exclamation&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"How 'scaped I <i>killing</i> when I crossed you so!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I wish, if possible, to support this view of the case by the
following passages:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I. Romeo's address to Balthasar.</p>
<p class="i4">"But if thou ... roaring sea."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>II. His address to Paris.</p>
<p class="i4">"I beseech thee youth ... away!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act v. Sc. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>III. "The poor father was ready to fall down dead; but he
grasped the broken oar which was before him, jumped up, and called
in a faltering voice,&mdash;'Arrigozzo! Arrigozzo!' This was but
for a moment. Receiving no answer, he ran to the top of the rock;
looked at all around, ran his eye over all who were safe, one by
one, but could not find his son among them. Then seeing the count,
who had so lately been finding fault <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page276" id="page276"></a>{276}</span> with his son's name, he
roared out,&mdash;'Dog, are you here?' And, brandishing the broken
oar, he rushed forward to strike him on the head. Bice uttered a
cry, Ottorino was quick in warding off the blow; in a minute, Lupo,
the falconer, and the boatmen, disarmed the frantic man; who,
striking his forehead with both hands, gave a spring, and threw
himself into the lake.</p>
<p>"He was seen fighting with the angry waves, overcoming them with
a strength and a courage which desperation alone can
give."&mdash;<i>Marco Viconti</i>, vol. i. chap. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IV. A passage that has probably already occurred to the mind of
the reader, Mucklebackit mending the cable in which his son had
been lost:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'There is a curse either on me or on this auld black bitch of a
boat, that I have hauled up high and dry, and pitched and clouted
sae mony years, that she might drown my poor Steenie at the end of
them, an' be d&mdash;&mdash;d to her!' And he flung his hammer
against the boat, as if she had been the intentional cause of his
misfortune"&mdash;<i>Antiquary</i>, vol. ii. chap. 13. Cadell,
1829.</p>
<p>V. "Giton pr&aelig;cipu&egrave;, <i>ex dolore in rabiem
efferatus</i>, tollit clamorem, me, utr&acirc;que manu impulsum,
pr&aelig;cipitat super lectum."&mdash;Petron. <i>Arb. Sat.</i> cap.
94.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The classical reader will at once recognise the force of the
words "rabiem," "efferatus," "pr&aelig;cipitat," in this passage.
The expression "utr&acirc;que manu" may not at first sight arrest
his attention. It seems always used to express the most intense
eagerness; see</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ijecit utramque lacini&aelig; manum."&mdash;Pet. <i>Arb.

<h3>ETYMOLOGICAL NOTES.</h3>
<p>1. <i>Gnatch.</i>&mdash;"The covetous man dares not gnatch"
(Hammond's <i>Catechism</i>). From this, and the examples in
Halliwell's <i>Dictionary</i>, the sense seems to be "to move." Is
it related to "gnake?"</p>
<p>2. <i>Pert.</i>&mdash;I lately met with an instance of the use
of this word in the etymological sense <i>peritus</i>: "I beant
peart at making button-holes," said a needlewoman.</p>
<p>3. <i>Rococo.</i>&mdash;A far-fetched etymology suggests itself.
A wealthy noble from the north might express his admiration for the
luxuries of Paris by the Russian word [Cyrillic: roskosha], or
Polish <i>roskosz</i>. A Frenchman, catching the sound, might apply
it to anything extravagant enough to astonish a barbarian.</p>
<p>4. <i>Cad.</i>&mdash;The letters from Scotland ascribed to a
Captain Burtt, employed in surveying the forfeited estates, give an
account of the "cawdies," or errand boys, of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>5. <i>Fun</i>, perhaps Irish, <i>fonamhad</i>, jeering, mockery
(Lhuyd, <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica</i>).</p>
<p>6. <i>Bumbailiff.</i>&mdash;The French have <i>pousse-cul</i>,
for the follower or assistant to the sergeant.</p>
<p>7. Epergne, perhaps <i>&eacute;pargne</i>, a save-all or
hold-all. Here seems no more difficulty in the transfer of the name
than in that of chiffonier, from a rag-basket to a piece of
ornamental furniture.</p>
<p>8. <i>Doggrel.</i>&mdash;Has the word any connexion with
<i>sdrucciolo</i>?</p>
<p>9. <i>Derrick.</i>&mdash;A spar arranged to form an extempore
crane. I think Derrick was the name of an executioner.</p>
<p>10. <i>Mece</i>, A.-S., a knife. The word is found in the
Sclavonic and Tartar dialects. I thinly I remember some years ago
reading in a newspaper of rioters armed with "pea makes." I do not
remember any other instance of its use in English.</p>

<h3>MISTAKES IN GIBBON.</h3>
<p>The following references may be of use to a future editor of
Gibbon; Mr. Milman has not, I believe, rectified any of the
mistakes pointed out by the authors cited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Netherlands ... 50,000 in less than fifty years were ...
sacrificed to the intolerance of popery. (Fra Paolo, <i>Sarpi Conc.
Trid.</i> 1. i. p. 422. ed. sec. Grotius, in his <i>Annal.
Belq.</i> 1. v. pp. 1G, 17. duod., including <i>all</i> the
persecutions of Charles V, makes the number 100,000. The supposed
contradiction between these two historians supplied Mr. Gibbon with
an argument by which he satisfied himself that be had completely
demolished the whole credibility of Eusebius's history. See
conclusion of his 16th book.) [Mendham's <i>Life of Pius V.</i>, p.
303. and note; compare p. 252., where Gibbon's attack on Eusebius
is discussed.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Forster's <i>Mahometanism Unveiled</i>, several of Gibbon's
statements are questioned. I have not the book at hand, and did not
think the corrections very important when I read it some time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id=
"page277"></a>{277}</span> back. The reader who has it may see pp.
339. 385. 461-2. 472. 483. 498. of the second volume.</p>
<p>In Dr. Maitland's <i>Dark Ages</i>, p. 229. seq. note, a gross
blunder is pointed out.</p>
<p>See too the <i>Gentlemans Magazine</i>, July, 1839, p. 49.</p>
<p>Dr. Maitland, in his <i>Facts and Documents relating to the
ancient Albigenses and Waldenses</i>, p. 217. note, corrects an
error respecting the <i>Book of Sentences</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gibbon, speaking of this <i>Book of Sentences</i>, in a note on
his 54th chapter, says, 'Of a list of criminals which fills
nineteen folio pages, only <i>fifteen</i> men and <i>four</i> women
were delivered to the secular arm.' Vol. v. p. 535. I believe he
should have said <i>thirty-two</i> men and <i>eight</i> women; and
imagine that he was misled by the fact that the index-maker most
commonly (but by no means always) states the nature of the sentence
passed on each person. From the book, however, it appears that
forty persons were so delivered, viz., twenty-nine Albigenses,
seven Waldenses, and four Beguins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following mistake was pointed out by the learned Cork
correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, I think in 1838;
it has misled the writer of the article "Anicius", in Smith's
<i>Dictionary of Ancient Biography</i>, and is not corrected by Mr.
Milman (Gibbon, chap. xxxi. note 14 and text):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During the first five ages, the name of the Anicians was
unknown. The earliest date in the annals of Pighius is that of M.
Anicius Gallus, Tr. Plebis A.U.C. 506. Another Tribune, Q. Anicius,
A.U.C. 508, is distinguished by the epithet Pr&aelig;nestinus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn from Pliny, <i>H.N.</i> xxxiii. 6., that Q. Anicius
Pr&aelig;nestinus was the colleague as curule &aelig;dile of
Flavius, the famous <i>scriba</i> of Appius C&aelig;cus, B.C. 304,
A.U.C. 450. (See Fischer, <i>R&ouml;m. Zeittafeln</i>, p. 61-2.)
Pliny's words are&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Flavius] tantam gratiam plebis adeptus est ... ut &aelig;dilis
curulis crearetur cum Q. Anicio Pr&aelig;nestino."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gibbon's chapter on Mahomet seems to be particularly
superficial; it is to be hoped that a future editor will correct it
by the aid of Von Hammer's labours.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES</h3>
<p><i>"Ockley's History of the Saracens," and unauthentic
Works.</i>&mdash;At the end of a late edition of Washington
Irving's <i>Life of Mahomet</i>, those "who feel inclined to peruse
further details of the life of Mahomet, or to pursue the course of
Saracenic history," are referred to <i>Ockley</i>. Students should
be aware of the character of the histories they peruse. And it
appears, from a note in Hallam's <i>Middle Ages</i> (vol. ii. p.
168.), that Wakidi, from whom Ockley translated his work, was a
"mere fabulist," as Reiske observes, in his preface to
Abulfeda.</p>
<p>Query, Would it not be well, if some of your more learned
correspondents would communicate to students, through the medium of
"NOTES AND QUERIES," a list of such books as are genuine but not
authentic; and authentic but not genuine, or altogether spurious?
or would point out the sources from which such information can be
obtained?</p>
<p class="author">P.H.F.</p>
<p><i>The Hippopotamus.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent L. (Vol. ii.,
p. 35.) says, "None of the Greek writers appear to have seen a live
hippopotamus:" and again, "The hippopotamus, being an inhabitant of
the Upper Nile, was imperfectly known to the ancients." Herodotus
says (ii. 71.) that this animal was held sacred by the Nomos of
Papremis, but not by the other Egyptians. The city of Papremis is
fixed by B&auml;hr in the west of the Delta (ad ii. 63.); and
Mannert conjectured it to be the same as the later Xo&iuml;s, lying
between the Sebennytic and Canopic branches, but nearer to the
former. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says, several representations of the
hippopotamus were found at Thebes, one of which he gives
(<i>Egyptians</i>, vol. iii. pl. xv.). Herodotus' way of speaking
would seem to show that he was describing from his own observation:
he used Hecat&aelig;us, no doubt, but did not blindly copy him.
Hence, I think, we may infer that Herodotus himself saw the
hippopotamus, and that this animal was found, in his day, even as
far north as the Delta: and also, that the species is gradually
dying out, as the aurochs is nearly gone, and the dodo quite. The
crocodile is no longer found in the Delta.</p>

<p><i>Pascal's Lettres Provinciales.</i>&mdash;I take the liberty
of forwarding to you the following "Note," suggested by two curious
blunders which fell under my notice some time ago.</p>
<p>In Mr. Stamp's reprint of the Rev. C. Elliott's <i>Delineation
of Romanism</i> (London, 8vo. 1844), I find (p. 471., in note) a
long paragraph on Pascal's <i>Lettres Provinciales</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This exquisite production," says the English editor, "<i>is
accompanied, in some editions of it, with the learned and judicious
observations of Nicole</i>, who, under the fictitious name of
Guillaume Wendrock, has fully demonstrated the truths of those
facts which Pascal had advanced without quoting his authorities;
and has placed, in a full and striking light, several interesting
circumstances which that great man had treated with perhaps too
much brevity. <i>These letters ... were translated into Latin by
Ruchelius</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Mr. Stamp's remarks the reader is led to conclude that the
<i>text</i> of the <i>Lettres Provinciales</i> <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>{278}</span> is
accompanied in some editions by observations of Wendrock (Nicole),
likewise in the French language. Now such an assertion merely
proves how carelessly some annotators will study the subjects they
attempt to elucidate. Nicole <i>translated</i> into Latin the
<i>Provincial Letters</i>; and the masterly disquisitions which he
added to the volume were, in their turn, "made French" by
Mademoiselle de Joncoux, and annexed to the editions of 1700, 1712,
1735.</p>
<p>As for Rachelius, if Mr. Stamp had taken the trouble to refer to
Placcius' <i>Theatr. Anonym. et Pseud.</i>, he night have seen
(Art. 2,883.) that this worthy was merely a German <i>editor</i>,
not a translator of Pascal cum Wendrock.</p>
<p>The second blunder I have to notice has been perpetrated by the
writer of an otherwise excellent article on Pascal in the last
number of the <i>British Quarterly Review</i> (No. 20. August). He
mentions Bossuet's edition of the <i>Pens&eacute;es</i>, speaks of
"<i>the prelate</i>," and evidently ascribes to the famous Bishop
of Meaux, <i>who died in</i> 1704, the edition of Pascal's
<i>Thoughts, published in</i> 1779 <i>by Bossuet</i>. (See pp. 140.
142.)</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>"ORKNEYINGA SAGA."</h3>
<p>In the introduction to Lord Ellesmere's <i>Guide to Northern
Arch&aelig;ology</i>, p. xi., is mentioned the intended publication
by the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries, Copenhagen, of a
volume of historical antiquities to be called <i>Antiquitates
Britannic&aelig; et Hibernic&aelig;</i>. In the contents of this
volume is noticed the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, a history of the
Orkney and Zetland Isles from A.D. 865 to 1234, of which there is
only the edition Copenhagen, 1780, "chiefly printed," it is said,
"from a modern paper manuscript, and by no means from the
celebrated Codex Flateyensis written on parchment in the fourteenth
century." This would show that the Codex Flateyensis was the most
valuable manuscript of the work published under the name of the
<i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, of which its editor, Jonas Jon&aelig;us, in
his introductory address to the reader, says its author and age are
equally unknown: "auctor incertus incerto &aelig;que tempore
scripsit." The <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i> concludes with the burning of
Adam Bishop, of Caithness, by the mob at Thurso while John was Earl
of Orkney, and according to Dalrymple's <i>Annals</i> in A.D. 1222;
but in the narrative given by the historian Torf&aelig;us, in his
<i>Orcades</i>, of Haco, King of Norway's expedition against the
western coast of Scotland in 1263, which terminated in the defeat
of the invaders by the Scots at Largs, in Ayrshire, and the death
of King Haco on his return back in the palace of the bishop of
Orkney at Kirkwall, reference is made to the Codex Flateyensis as
to the burial of King Haco in the city of Bergen, in Norway, where
his remains were finally deposited, after lying some months before
the shrine of the patron saint in the cathedral of Saint Magnus, at
Kirkwall. There is not a syllable of King Haco or his expedition in
the <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>; and as I cannot reconcile this
reference of Torf&aelig;us (2nd edition, 1715, book ii. p. 170.)
with the <i>Saga</i>, the favour of information is desired from
some of your antiquarian correspondents. The Codex Flateyensis has
been ascribed to a pensioner of the king of Norway resident in
Flottay, one of the southern isles of Orkney, but with more
probability can be attributed to some of the monks of the monastery
built on the small island of Flatey, lying in Breida Fiord, a gulf
on the west coast of Iceland.</p>

<p><i>Wife of Edward the Outlaw.</i>&mdash;Can any of your
correspondents inform me who was the wife of Edward the Outlaw, and
consequently mother of Margaret of Scotland, and ancestress of the
kings of England?</p>
<p>The account adopted by most historians is that Canute, in 1017,
sent the two sons of Edmund Ironside to the king of Denmark, whence
they were transferred to Solomon, king of Hungary, who gave his
sister to the eldest; and, on his death without issue, married the
second Edward to Agatha, daughter of the Emperor Henry II. (or, in
some accounts, Henry III., or even, in Grafton's <i>Chronicles</i>,
called Henry IV.), and sister to his own queen.</p>
<p>That Edward the Outlaw returned to England in 1057, having had
five children, of whom three survived: Edgar; Margaret, who in 1067
married King Malcolm of Scotland, and another daughter.</p>
<p>Now this account is manifestly incorrect. The Emperor Henry II.
died childless: when on his death-bed he restored his wife to her
parents, declaring that both he and she had kept their vows of
chastity.</p>
<p>Solomon did not ascend the throne of Hungary until 1063, in
which year he had also married Sophia, daughter of the Emperor
Henry III.; but this monarch (who was born in October, 1017,
married his first wife in 1036, who died, leaving one child, in
1038 and his second wife in November 1043) could not be the
grandfather of the five children of Edward the Outlaw, born prior
to 1057.</p>

emperor's cousin.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>CAVE'S HISTORIA LITERARIA.</h3>
<p>I do not know whether the notices respecting Cave's <i>Historia
Literaria</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 230. 255.) hold out any prospect of a
new edition. It is much to be desired; and as it may be done at
some time or other, you will perhaps allow me to make a Note of a
circumstance which accidentally came to my knowledge, and should be
known to any future editor. It is simply this: in the second volume
of the Oxford edition of 1740, after the three dissertations,
&amp;c., there are fifteen pages, with a fresh pagination of their
own, entitled, "Not&aelig; MSS. et Accessiones <i>Anonymi</i> ad
Cavei Historiam Literariam, Codicis Margini adscript&aelig;, in
Bibliotheca Lambethana. Manus est plane Reverendiss. <i>Thom&aelig;
Tenison</i>, Cantuariensis Archiepiscopi." Not to occupy more of
your valuable space than is necessary, I will merely observe that
the "Anonymus" was not Archbishop Tenison, but Henry Wharton. There
can be no doubt in the mind of any person acquainted with the
handwriting of the parties; and to those to whom such a notice is
likely to be of any use at all, it is unnecessary to say that the
difference is important. I need scarcely add, that if ever a new
edition is undertaken, Wharton's books and papers, and other things
in the Lambeth collection of MSS., should be examined.</p>

<h3>SIR GAMMER VANS.</h3>
<p>In reply to C.'s inquiry (Vol. ii., p. 89.) as to a comic story
about one <i>Sir Gammer Vans</i>, I have pleasure in communicating
what little information I have on the subject. Some years ago, when
I was quite a boy, the story was told me by an Irish clergyman,
since deceased. He spoke of it as an old Irish tradition, but did
not give his authority for saying so. The story, as he gave it,
contained no allusion to an "aunt" or "mother." I do not know
whether it will be worthy of publication: but here it is, and you
can make what use of it you like:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Last Sunday morning at six o'clock in the evening, as I was
sailing over the tops of the mountains in my little boat, I met two
men on horseback riding on one mare: so I asked them 'Could they
tell me whether the little old woman was dead yet, who was hanged
last Saturday week for drowning herself in a shower of feathers?'
They said they could not positively inform me, but if I went to Sir
Gammar Vans he could tell me all about it. 'But how am I to know
the house?' said I. 'Ho, 'tis easy enough,' said they, 'for it's a
brick house, built entirely of flints, standing alone by itself in
the middle of sixty or seventy others just like it.' 'Oh, nothing
in the world is easier,' said I. 'Nothing <i>can</i> be easier,'
said they: so I went on my way. Now this Sir G. Vans was a giant,
and bottlemaker. And as all giants, who <i>are</i> bottlemakers,
usually pop out of a little thumb bottle from behind the door, so
did Sir G. Vans. 'How d'ye do?' says he. 'Very well, thank you,'
says I. 'Have some breakfast with me?' 'With all my heart,' says I.
So he gave me a slice of beer, and a cup of cold veal; and there
was a little dog under the table that picked up all the crumbs.
'Hang him,' says I. 'No, don't hang him,' says he; 'for he killed a
hare yesterday. And if you don't believe me, I'll show you the hare
alive in a basket.' So he took me into his garden to show me the
curiosities. In one corner there was a fox hatching eagle's eggs;
in another there was an iron apple tree, entirely covered with
pears and lead; in the third there was the hare which the dog
killed yesterday alive in the basket; and in the fourth there were
twenty-four <i>hipper switches</i> threshing tobacco, and at the
sight of me they threshed so hard that they drove the plug through
the wall, and through a little dog that was passing by on the other
side. I, hearing the dog howl, jumped over the wall; and turned it
as neatly inside out as possible, when it ran away as if it had not
an hour to live. Then he took me into the park to show me his deer:
and I remembered that I had a warrant in my pocket to shoot venison
for his majesty's dinner. So I set fire to my bow, poised my arrow,
and shot amongst them. I broke seventeen ribs on one side, and
twenty-one and a half on the other: but my arrow passed clean
through without ever touching it, and the worst was I lost my
arrow; however, I found it again in the hollow of a tree. I felt
it: it felt clammy. I smelt it; it smelt honey. 'Oh, ho!' said I,
'here's a bee's nest,' when out sprung a covey of partridges. I
shot at them; some say I killed eighteen, but I am sure I killed
thirty-six, besides a dead salmon which was flying over the bridge,
of which I made the best apple pie I ever tasted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the story: I can answer for its general accuracy. I am
quite at sea as to the meaning and orthography of "hipper
switches,"&mdash;having heard, not seen, the story.</p>

<h3>THE COLLAR OF SS.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., pp. 89. 194. 248.)</h4>
<p>The Collar of SS. "is to this day a mystery to the most learned
and indefatigable antiquaries," according to Mr. Planch&eacute;, in
his valuable little work on <i>The History of British Costume</i>:
what has appeared in "NOTES AND QUERIES" certainly has not cleared
away the obscurity. ARMIGER tells us (Vol. ii., p. 195.): "As to
the derivation of the name of the collar from <i>Soverayne</i>;
from St. Simplicius; from the martyrs of Soissons (viz. St. Crespin
and St. Crespinian, upon whose anniversary the battle of Agincourt
was fought); from the Countess of Salisbury; from the word
<i>Souvenez</i>; and, lastly, from Seneschallus or Steward, (which
latter is MR. NICHOLS' notion)&mdash;they may be regarded as mere
monkish (?) or heraldic gossip." If the monastic writers had spoken
anything on the matter, a doubt never would have existed: but none
of them has even hinted at it. Never having seen the articles in
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, I do not know MR. NICHOLS' reasons
for supposing "Seneschallus or Steward" could have furnished an
origin of the SS.; but I am at loss to think of any grounds upon
which such a guess could rest. From the searches I have made upon
this question, it seems to me that these SS. are taken as a short
way of expressing the "SANCTUS, SANCTUS, SANCTUS" of the Salisbury
liturgy and ritual. I hope soon to be able to lay before the public
the documents out of which I draw this opinion, in a note to the
third and forthcoming volume of <i>The Church of our
Fathers</i>.</p>

<h3>JOACHIN, THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 229.)</h4>
<p>Your correspondent AMICUS will I fear find very little
information about this mysterious person in the writers of French
history of the time. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id=
"page281"></a>{281}</span> He is thus mentioned in Cavendish's
<i>Life of Wolsey</i> (ed. 1825, vol. i. p. 73.):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The French king lying in his camp, sent secretly into England a
privy person, a very witty man, to entreat of a peace between him
and the king our sovereign lord, whose name was John Joachin; he
was kept as secret as might be, that no man had intelligence of his
repair; for he was no Frenchman, but an Italian born, a man before
of no estimation in France, or known to be in favour with his
master, but to be a merchant; and for his subtle wit, elected to
entreat of such affairs as the king had commanded him by embassy.
This Joachin, after his arrival here in England, was secretly
conveyed unto the king's manor of Richmond, and there remained
until Whitsuntide; at which time the cardinal resorted thither, and
kept there the said feast very solemnly. In which season my lord
caused this Joachin divers times to dine with him, whose talk and
behaviour seemed to be witty, sober, and wondrous discreet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My note on this passage says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The name of this person was Giovanni Joacchino Passano, a
Genoese; he was afterwards called Seigneur de Vaux. The emperor, it
appears, was informed of his being in England, and for what
purpose. The cardinal stated that Joacchino came over as a
merchant; and that as soon as he discovered himself to be sent by
the lady regent of France, he made De Pr&aelig;t (the emperor's
ambassador) privy thereto, and likewise of the answer given to her
proposals. The air of mystery which attached to this mission
naturally created suspicion; and, after a few months, De
Pr&aelig;t, in his letters to the emperor, and to Margaret,
governess of the Netherlands, expressed his surmise that all was
not right, alleging his reasons. His letters were intercepted by
the cardinal, and read before the council. Charles and Margaret
complained of the insult, and the cardinal explained as well as he
could: at the same time protesting against the misinterpretation of
De Pr&aelig;t, and assuring them that nothing could be further from
his wish than that any disunion should arise between the king his
master and the emperor; and notwithstanding the suspicious aspect
of this transaction, his dispatches, both before and after this
fracas, strongly corroborate his assertions. Wolsey suspected that
the Pope was inclined toward the cause of Francis, and reminded him
of his obligations to Henry and Charles. The Pope had already taken
the alarm, and had made terms with the French king, but had
industriously concealed it from Wolsey, and at length urged in his
excuse that he had no alternative. Joacchino was again in England
upon a different mission, and was an eye-witness of the melancholy
condition of the cardinal when his fortunes were reversed. He
sympathised with him, and interested himself for him with Francis
and the queen dowager, as appears by his letters published in
<i>Legrand, Histoire du Divorce de Henry VIII</i>."</p>

<h3>REMAINS OF JAMES II.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 243.).</h4>
<p>The following passage is transcribed from a communication
relative to the Scotch College at Paris, made by the Rev. H.
Longueville Jones to the <i>Collectanea Topographica et
Genealogica</i>, 1841, vol. vii. p. 33.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The king left his brains to this college; and, it used to be
said, other parts, but this is more doubtful, to the Irish and
English colleges at Paris. His heart was bequeathed to the Dames de
St. Marie at Chaillot, and his entrails were buried at St.
Germain-en-Laye, where a handsome monument has been erected to his
memory by order of George IV.; but the body itself was interred in
the monastery of English Benedictine Monks that once existed in the
Rue du Faubourg St. Jacques, close to the Val de Grace. In this
latter house, previous to the Revolution, the following simple
inscription marked where the monarch's body lay:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'CI GIST JACQUES II. ROI DE LA GRANDE BRETAGNE.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A monument to the king still exists in the chapel of the Scotch
College (which is now leased to a private school), and the
inscription, in Latin, written by James, Duke of Perth, is printed
in the same volume of <i>Collectanea</i>, p. 35., followed by all
the other inscriptions to James's adherents now remaining in that
chapel.</p>
<p>In a subsequent communication respecting the Irish College at
Paris, made by the same gentleman, and printed in the same volume,
at p. 113. are these remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is not uninteresting to add, that the body of James II. was
brought to this college after the destruction of the English
Benedictine Monastery adjoining the Val de Grace; and remained for
some years in a temporary tomb in one of the lecture halls, then
used as the chapel. It was afterwards removed; by whose authority,
and to what place, is not exactly known: but it is considered not
improbable that it was transported to the church of St.
Germain-en-Laye, and there buried under the monument erected by
George IV. Some additional light will probably be thrown on this
subject, in a work on the Stuarts now in course of
compilation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has this work since appeared?</p>
<p class="author">J.G.N.</p>
<p><i>Interment of James II.</i>&mdash;I remember reading in the
French papers, in the year 1823 or 1824, a long account of the then
recent exhumation and re-interment in another spot of the remains
of James II. I was but a boy at the time, and neglected to make a
"Note", which might now be valuable to you. I have not the least
doubt, however, that the fact will be discovered on reference to a
file of the <i>Etoile</i>, or any other of the Paris papers of one
or other of the years above named.</p>
<p>There is a marble monument erected in memory of James, in the
chapel of the old Scotch College, in the Rue des Foss&eacute;s
Saint Victor. An urn of bronze, gilt, containing the king's brains,
formerly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id=
"page282"></a>{282}</span> stood on the crown of this monument. The
urn was smashed and the contents scattered over the ground, during
the French Revolution. A much more important loss to posterity was
incurred by the destruction of the manuscripts entrusted by James
to the keeping of the brotherhood he loved. The trust is alluded to
with mingled pride and affection in the noble and touching
inscription on the royal monument.</p>

<h3>HANDFASTING.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 151.)</h4>
<p>Your correspondent J.M.G. has brought forward a curious subject,
and one well deserving attention and illustration. A fair is said
to have been held at the meeting of the Black and White Esks, at
the foot of Eskdalemuir, in Dumfriesshire, when the singular custom
of <i>Handfasting</i> was observed. The old statistical account of
the parish says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At that fair it was the custom for unmarried persons of both
sexes to choose a companion according to their liking, whom they
were to live with till <i>that time next year</i>. This was called
<i>handfasting</i>, or hand-in-fist. If they were pleased with each
other at that time, then they continued together for life; if not,
they separated, and were free to make another choice as at the
first."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Maxwell, Esq., of Broomholm, in a letter (dated April 15th,
1796) to the Rev. Wm. Brown, D.D., of Eskdalemuir, says, in
reference to this custom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No account can be given of the period at which the custom of
<i>handfasting</i> commenced; but I was told by an old man, John
Murray, who died at the farm of Irvine (as you go from Langholm to
Canobie), and had formerly been a proprietor in Eskdaldemuir, that
he was acquainted with, or at least had seen an old man, I think
his name was Beattie, who was grandson to a couple who had been
handfasted. You perhaps know that <i>the children born under the
handfasting engagement were reckoned lawful children, and not
bastards</i>, though the parents did afterwards resile. This custom
of handfasting does not seem to have been peculiar to your parish.
Mention is made in some histories of Scotland that Robert II. was
<i>handfasted</i> to Elizabeth More before he married Euphemia
Ross, daughter of Hugh, Earl of that name, by both of whom he had
children; his eldest son John, by Elizabeth More, viz., King Robert
III., commonly called Jock Ferngyear, succeeded to the throne in
preference to the sons of Euphemia, his married wife. Indeed, after
Euphemia's death, he married his former handfasted wife
Elizabeth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir J. Chardin observes that contracts for temporary wives are
frequent in the East, which contracts are made before the Cadi with
the formality of a measure of corn, mentioned over and above the
stipulated sum of money.</p>
<p>Baron du Tott's account of "Marriages by Capin," corroborated by
Eastern travellers, corresponds with the custom of
<i>Handfasting</i>. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is another kind of marriage which, stipulating the return
to be made, fixes likewise the time when the divorce is to take
place. This contract is called <i>capin</i>: and, properly
speaking, is only an agreement between the parties to live together
<i>for such a price, during such a time</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contract is a regular form of marriage, and is so regarded
generally in the East.</p>
<p>The Jews seem to have had a similar custom, which perhaps they
borrowed from the neighbouring nations; at least the connexion
formed by the prophet Hosea (chap. iii. 2.) bears a strong
resemblance to <i>Handfasting</i> and <i>Capin</i>.</p>

<h3>ADAM OF BREMEN'S JULIN.</h3>
<p>In reply to V. from Belgravia (Vol. ii., p. 230.), I am
partially at a loss to know the exact bearing of his Query. Adam of
Bremen's account of Julin is no <i>legend</i>, nor does he mention
it at all as a <i>doomed city</i>. On the contrary, his description
is that of a flourishing emporium of commerce, for which purpose he
selects very strong superlatives, as in the following account
(<i>De Situ Dam&aelig;</i>, lib. ii. cap. ii.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultra Leuticos qui alio nomine Welzi dicuntur Oddera Flumen
occurrit; amnis dilectissimus Slavonic&aelig; regionis. In cujus
ostro, qui Scythicas alludet paludes, nobilissima civitas Julinum
celeberrimam Barbaris et Gr&aelig;cis qui in circuitu pr&aelig;stet
stationem. De cujus pr&aelig;conio quia magna et vix credibilia
recitantur, volupe arbitror pauca inserere digna relata. Est sane
maxime omnium quas Europa claudit civitatum, quam incolunt Slavi
cum aliis gentibus Gr&aelig;cis et Barbaris. Nam et adven&aelig;
Saxones parem cohabitandi legem acceperunt, si tamen
Christianitatis titulum ibi morantes non publicaverint. Omnes enim
adhuc paganicis ritibus aberrant, ceterum moribus et hospitalitate
nulla gens honestior aut benignior poterit inveniri. Urbs illa
mercibus omnium septentrionalium nationum locuples nihil non habet
jucundi et rari."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Adam is supposed to have been a native and a priest at
Magdeburg, whence he was translated by Archbishop Adalbert to a
benefice in the cathedral of Bremen, he must, from his comparative
proximity to the spot, be supposed a competent witness; and there
is not reason to suppose why he should not have been also a
creditable one. He died about 1072, and the <i>legends</i>, if any,
concerning this famous place, here described as the most extensive
in Europe, must have been subsequently framed.</p>
<p>For about one hundred years later (1184) we have from Helmold,
the parish priest of B&ouml;san, a small village on the eastern
confines of Holstein, a repetition of Adam's words, for a place
which he calls <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id=
"page283"></a>{283}</span> "Veneta," but always in the past tense
as, "quondam fuit nobilissima civitas," etc.; so that it is plain
from that and his expression "excidium civitatis;" as well as,
"Hanc civitatem opulentissimam quidam Danorum rex, maxima classe
stipatus, fundetus evertisse refertur." The great question is,
Where was this great city? and, are the <i>Julin</i> of Adam and
the <i>Veneta</i> of Helmold identical? Both questions have given
rise to endless discussions amongst German arch&aelig;ologists. The
published maps, as late at least as the end of the last century,
had a note at a place in the Baltic, opposite to the small town of
Demmin, in Pomerania:&mdash;"Hic Veneta emporium olim celeberr.
&aelig;quar. &aelig;stu absorpt." Many, perhaps the majority, of
recent writers contend for the town of Wallin, which gives its name
to one of the islands by which the Stettin Haff is
formed,&mdash;though the slight verbal conformity seems to be their
principal ground; for no <i>rudera</i>, no vestiges of ancient
grandeur now mark the spot, not even a tradition of former
greatness: whilst Veneta, which can only be taken to mean the
<i>civitas</i> of the Veneti, a nation placed by Tacitus on this
part of the coast, has a long unbroken chain of oral evidence in
its favour, as close to Rugen; and, if authentic records are to be
credited, ships have been wrecked in the last century on ancient
moles or bulwarks, which then rose nearly to the surface from the
submerged ruins. But the subject is much too comprehensive for the
compressed notices of your miscellany. I hope to have shortly an
opportunity of treating the subject at large in reference to the
Schiringsheal which Othere described to King Alfred, about two
hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>An edition of Adam and Helmold is very desirable in England,
even in a translations as a part of Bohn's <i>Antiquarian
Series</i>.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Bess of Hardwick</i> (Vol. i., p. 276.).&mdash;The following
particulars in answer to this Query will, I hope, elicit some
further information from other quarters. I have, in my answer,
attempted to be as brief as possible.</p>
<p>John, the fifth recorded Hardwick, of Hardwick, left issue, by
Elizabeth Leake, six children: of whom JAMES (or John) was thrice
married, and died <i>sine prole</i>, and DOROTHY died an infant:
the four remaining daughters became coheiresses.</p>
<p>Of these MARY HARDWICK married (his first wife) Richard
Wingfield, of Wantisden, seventh son of Sir Anthony Wingfield, of
Letheringham, co. Suffolk, K.G. His will was proved in London 14th
August, 1591. Their eldest son <i>Henry</i> was of Crowfield, co.
Suffolk. His great-grandson, <i>Harbottle Wingfield</i>, of
Crowfield, was living 1644, and his descendants, if any, may
quarter Hardwick. Their second son, <i>Anthony Wingfield</i>, was
the well-known Greek reader to Queen Elizabeth; and their third
son, <i>Sir John Wingfield</i>, married Susan Bertie, Countess
Dowager of Kent, and left <i>Peregrin Wingfield</i>, of whom
nothing is recorded.</p>
<p>JANE HARDWICK, next daughter, married Godfrey Bosvile of
Gunthwaite and Beighton, co. Ebor. His will is dated 22nd July,
1580. Their eldest child, <i>Francis Bosvile</i>, left only
daughter, Grace Bosvile, who died young. His three sisters became
coheirs, but the estate of Gunthwaite went to an uncle, ancestor of
the present Godfrey Bosvile, Lord Macdonald. Of these sisters,
<i>Frances Bosvile</i> married John Savile; <i>Dorothy Bosvile</i>,
John Lacy; and <i>Elizabeth Bosvile</i>, John Copley: either they
had no children, or these died young. <i>Mary Bosvile</i>, the
second daughter and coheir, married Richard Burdett, of Derby,
living 1612. Their son, <i>George Burdett</i>, had by his first
wife a son, whose issue failed; and by his second wife two
daughters, eventually coheirs.</p>
<p>Of these. <i>Mary Burdett</i> married, first, Richard
Pilkington, and second, Sir T. Beaumont, of Whitby: and <i>another
sister</i> married&mdash;Ramsden. No issue of either are recorded.
The third sister, <i>Elizabeth Burdett</i>, married, at Hoyland,
6th Feb., 1636, the Rev. Daniel Clark, A.M., and died 27th Aug.,
1679, at Fenney-Compton. Their great-grandson and sole male
representative was the late <i>Joseph Clark</i> of Northampton,
whose descendants also quarter Hardwick.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH HARDWICK, the next daughter, was the celebrated
Countess of Shrewsbury. Her <i>representatives</i> are all noble,
and their pedigrees may be found in the Peerages. They
are&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>The Duke of Devonshire</i>, representing Wm. Cavendish,
first earl.</p>
<p>Certain descendants of Sir Charles Cavendish, of Welbeck Abbey,
or rather of his grandson, Henry, second Duke of Newcastle,
namely,</p>
<p>2. The <i>Duke of Portland</i>, representing Margaret Pelham,
the Duke's eldest coheir;</p>
<p>3. The <i>Marquis of Salisbury</i> from Catherine, and second
coheir;</p>
<p>4. The <i>Earl De la Warr</i>; and</p>
<p>5. The <i>Earl of Aboyne</i>, are the coheirs of Sir Charles
Cope, Baronet, of Orton; who represented Arabella, Countess of
Sunderland, third coheir. These five all quarter Hardwick.</p>
<p>ALICE HARDWICK, next daughter, married Francis Hercy, according
to some pedigrees. No issue recorded.</p>
<p>There are therefore descendants certainly known of only two of
the children of John Hardwick. Possibly some of your correspondents
can supply those of Wingfield and Hercy.</p>
<p>The crest and arms of the Hardwicks may be found in Edmondson.
They only quartered Pynchbeke. I am not aware of any motto.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id=
"page284"></a>{284}</span>
<p>Miss Costello, and other biographers of the Countess of
Shrewsbury, have quite overlooked all the descendants of her
sisters. Possibly, should these lines meet the eye of the Duke of
Devonshire, who possesses the estates and papers of the Hardwicks,
it may lead to more particulars concerning the family being made
public.</p>

somewhat careless, as Carpaccio and his works are fully described

figures of his, of which Mrs. Jameson has given a St. Stephen in

hoped the Arundel Society will introduce by their engravings. I

<p><i>Walrond Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 206.).&mdash;Burke, in his
<i>History of the Commoners</i>, only gives the name of George,
<i>one</i> of the sons of Colonel Humphry Walrond. He also states
that the colonel married <i>Elizabeth</i>, daughter of Nathaniel
Napier, Esq., of More Critchel. Now Colonel Walrond appears from
his petition (Royalist Comp. Papers, State Paper Office) dated 12th
February, 1648, addressed to the Commissioners for Compounding with
Delinquents, to have had <i>nine</i> other children then living. He
states: "Thus his eldest sonne George Walrond did absente himselfe
for a short time from his father's house, and went into the king's
army, where he unfortunately lost his right arme. That he having no
estate at present, and but little in expectancy after his father's
death, <i>he having ten</i> children, and all <i>nine</i> to be
provided for out of y'e petitioner's small estate." In a similar
petition, dated about two years later, from "<i>Grace</i>, the wife
of Humphry Walrond, of Sea, in the county of Somerset, Esquire,"
she states "herself to be weake woman, and <i>having</i> TEN
children (whereof many are infants) to maintain." That he was
married to this <i>Grace</i>, and <i>not to Elizabeth</i> (as
stated by Burke), as early as 1634, is clear from a licence to
alienate certain lands at Ilminster, 10 Ch. I. (<i>Pat.
Rolls</i>.)</p>
<p>That they were both living in 1668 is proved by a petition in
the State Paper Office (Read in Council, Ap. 8, 1688. Trade Papers,
Verginia, No. I. A.):&mdash;"To the King's most excellent Ma'tie
and the rt. hon'ble the Lords of his Maj. most hon'ble Privy
Councel," from "Grace, the wife of Humphry Walrond, Esq." In this
petition she states that her husband had been very severely
prosecuted by Lord Willoughby, whose sub-governor he had been in
Barbadoes. "He had contracted many debts by reason of his loyalty
and suffering in the late troubles, to the loss of at least thirty
thousand pounds." "That his loyalty and sufferings are notoriously
known, both in this kingdom and the Barbadoes, where he was
banished for proclaiming your Ma'tie after the murder of your royal
father." Colonel Walrond is mentioned by Clarendon, Rushworth,
Whitelock, &amp;c.; but of the date of his death, the maiden name
of his wife, and the Christian names of all his ten children, I can
find no account.</p>

order of Pilate, according to the legend, and afterwards was, among
other relics, carried to Rome. It is now in the Church of St. John
Lateran, whither it is said to have been brought by St. Helena from
Jerusalem. Pope Alexander Vl., and his successor Julius, granted to
the Chapel of St. Mary built by King Henry VII., in Westminster
Abbey&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Easdem indulgencias et peccatorum remissiones ... quas
Celebrantes pro Defunctis in Capell&acirc; <i>Scala Coeli</i>
nuncupat&acirc; in Ecclesi&acirc; Trium Fontium extra muros Urbis
Cisterciensis Ordinis ... consequuntur."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This indulgence of Pope Julius was dated in the year 1504; and
its intention of drawing thither pilgrims and offerings was fully
realised, we may believe: for in the year 1519 we find the
brotherhood of St. Mary of Rouncevall by Charing Cross
paying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To the keper of Scala Celi in the Abby ... vjd."</p>

<p><i>Sitting during the Lessons</i> (Vol. ii., p. 46.).&mdash;With
respect to L.'s Query respecting sitting during the Lessons, I can
venture no remarks; but the custom of standing during the reading
of the Gospel is very ancient. In the mass of St. Chrysostom the
priest exclaims, "Stand up, let us hear the holy Gospel." (Goar,
<i>Rituale Gr&aelig;corum</i>, p. 69.) The same custom appears in
the Latin Liturgy of St. Basil:&mdash;"Cumque interpres Evangelii
dicit 'State cum timore Dei' convertitur Sacerdos ad occidentem,"
etc. (<i>Renaudot</i>, vol. i. p. 7. Vide also "Liturgy of St.
Mark," <i>Ren</i>. vol. i. p. 126.) The edition of Renaudot's
<i>Liturgies</i> is the reprint in 1847.</p>
<p class="author">N.E.R. (a subscriber).</p>
<p><i>Sitting during the Lessons.</i>&mdash;There is no doubt, I
believe, that in former times the people stood when the minister
read the Lessons, to show their reverence. It is recorded in
Nehemiah, viii. 5.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Ezra opened the Book in the sight of all the people (for he
was above all the people), and when he opened it all the people
<i>stood</i> up."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why this practice should have been altered, or why our Rubric
should be silent on this head, does not appear quite clear, though
I find in Wheatley (<i>On the Book of Common Prayer</i>, chap. vi.
sec. vi.) that which seems to me to be a very sufficient reason, if
not for the sitting during the Lessons, certainly for the standing
during the reading of the Gospel, and sitting during the
Epistle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In St. Augustine's time the people always stood when the
lessons were read, to show their reverence to God's holy word: but
afterwards, when this was thought too great a burden, they were
allowed to sit down at the lessons, and were only obliged to
<i>stand</i> at the reading of the Gospel; which always contains
something that Our Lord did speak, or suffered in His own person.
By which gesture they showed they had a greater respect to the Son
of God himself than they had to any other inspired person, though
speaking the word of God, and by God's authority."</p>

<p><i>A&euml;rostation, Works on</i> (Vol. ii., p. 199.).&mdash;To
the numerous list of works on A&euml;rostation which will no doubt
be communicated to you in answer to the inquiry of C.B.M., I beg to
add the following small contribution:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Saggio Aereonautico di Giuseppe Donini Tifernate," 8vo. pp. 92.
With four large folding Plates. Firenze 1819.</p>
<p>Signor Donini also published in 1823 (in Citta di Castello per
il Donati) the following pamphlet:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Circolare Areonautico (sic) Guiseppe Dolini d Citt&agrave; di
Castello a tutti i dotti, e ricchi nazionali, stranieri. 8vo." pp.
16. Oxford.</p>
<p class="author">J.M.</p>
<p><i>A&euml;rostation.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent C.B.M. (Vol.
ii., p. 199.) will find some curious matter of
<i>a&euml;rostation</i> in poor Colonel Maceroni's
<i>Autobiography</i>, 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
<p class="author">W.C.</p>
<p><i>Pole Money</i> (Vol. ii., p. 231.).&mdash;The "pole money"
alluded to in the extracts given by T.N.I., was doubtless the poll
tax, which was revived in the reign of Charles II. Every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id=
"page286"></a>{286}</span> knows that at an earlier period of our
history it gave rise to Wat Tyler's insurrection. The tax was
reimposed several times during the reign of William III. and it
appears from a statement of the Lords in a conference which took
place with the Commons on the subject in the first of William's
reign, that the tax, previously to that time, was last imposed in
the 29th of Charles II.</p>
<p class="author">C. ROSS.</p>
<p><i>Wormwood Wine</i> (Vol. ii., p. 242.).&mdash;If, as MR.
SINGER supposes, "Eisell was absynthites, or wormwood wine, a
nauseously bitter medicament then much in use," Pepys' friends must
have had a very singular taste, for he records, on the 24th
November, 1660,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Creed and Shepley, and I, to the Rhonish wine house, and there
I did give them two quarts of wormwood wine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the beverage was doctored for the English market, and
rendered more palatable than it had been in the days of
Stuckius.</p>
<p class="author">BRAYBROOKE.</p>
<p><i>Darvon Gatherall</i> (Vol. ii., p. 199.).&mdash;Dervel Gadarn
(vulgarly miscalled Darvel Gatheren) was son or grandson of Hywel
or Hoel, son to Emyr of Britany. He was the founder of Llan-dervel
Church, in Merioneth, and lived early in the sixth century. The
destruction of his image is mentioned in the <i>Letters on the
Suppression of Monasteries</i>, Nos. 95. and 101. Some account of
it also exists in Lord Herbert's <i>Henry VIII.</i>, which I cannot
refer to. I was not aware his name had ever undergone such gross
and barbarous corruption as <i>Darvon Gatherall</i>.</p>
<p class="author">A.N.</p>
<p><i>Darvon Gatherall</i> (Vol. ii., p. 199.), or <i>Darvel
Gatheren</i>, is spoken of in Sir H. Ellis's <i>Original
Letters</i>, Series III., Letter 330. Hall's <i>Chronicle</i>, p.
826. ed. 1809.</p>
<p class="author">J.E.B. MAYOR.</p>
<p><i>Darvon Gatherall.</i>&mdash;I send you an extract from
Southey's <i>Common-place Book</i>, which refers to Darvon
Gatherall. Southey had copied it from Wordworth's <i>Ecclesiastical
Biography</i>, where it is given as quotation from Michael Wodde,
who wrote in 1554. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who could, twenty years agone, say the Lord's Prayer in
English?... If we were sick of the pestilence, we ran to St. Rooke:
if of the ague, to St. Pernel, or Master John Shorne. If men were
in prison, they prayed to St. Leonard. If the Welshman would have a
purse, he prayed to <i>Darvel Gathorne</i>. If a wife were weary of
a husband, she offered oats at Poules; at London, to St.
Uncumber."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can any of your readers inform me who St. Uncumber was?</p>
<p class="author">PWCCA.</p>
<p class="note">[Poules is St. Paul's. The passage from Michael
Wodde is quoted in Ellis' <i>Brand</i>, vol. i. p. 202. edit.
1841.]</p>
<p><i>Angels' Visits</i> (Vol. i., p. 102.).&mdash;WICCAMECUS will
find in Norris's <i>Miscellanies</i>, in a poem "To the Memory of
my dear Neece, M.C." (Stanza X. p. 10. ed. 1692), the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"No wonder such a noble mind</p>
<p>Her way to heaven so soon could find:</p>
<p>Angels, as 'tis but seldom they appear,</p>
<p>So neither do they make long stay;</p>
<p>They do but visit, and away."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Montgomery (<i>Christian Poet</i>) long ago compared this
passage with those cited by WICCAMECUS.</p>
<p class="author">J.E.B. MAYOR.</p>
<p><i>Antiquity of Smoking</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 41. 216.).&mdash;On
that interesting subject, "The Antiquity of Smoking," I beg to
contribute the following "Note," which I made some years ego, but
unfortunately without a reference to the author:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some fern was evidently in use among the ancients: for
Athen&aelig;us, in his first book, quotes from the Greek poet,
Crobylus, these words:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>[Greek:</p>
<p>'Kai ton larung haedista purio temachiois</p>
<p>Kaminos, ouk anthropos.']</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>'And I will sweetly burn my throat with cuttings:</p>
<p>A chimney, not a man!'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now as, in a preceding line, the smoker boasts of his
'Id&aelig;an fingers,' it is plain that every man rolled up his
sharoot for himself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">H.G.</p>
<p><i>Antiquity of Smoking</i> (Vol. ii., p.
216.).&mdash;<i>Herod</i>. lib. i. sec. 36. is referred to for some
illustration, I suppose, of smoking through tubes. <i>Herodotus</i>
supplies nothing: perhaps <i>Herodian</i> may be meant, though not
very likely. Herb smoking was probably in use in Europe long before
tobacco. But direct authority seems sadly wanting.</p>
<p class="author">SANDVICENSIS.</p>
<p>"<i>Noli me tangere</i>" (Vol. ii., pp. 153. 219.
250.).&mdash;In a New Testament published by the Portusian Bible
Society is a small ill-executed print, called "Christ appearing to
Mary," copied from a picture by C. Ciguani.</p>
<p class="author">WEDSECNARF.</p>
<p><i>Partrige Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 230.).&mdash;Mr. Partrige's
reference to Strype's <i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i> is quite
unintelligible to those who have not access to the Oxford
<i>reprint</i> of that work. The reprint (I wish that in all other
reprints a similar course was adopted) gives the paging of the
original folio edition. I submit, therefore, that Mr. Partrige
should have stated that the note he has made is from Strype's
<i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i>, vol. ii. p. 310.</p>
<p>The grant to which Mr. Partrige refers is, I dare say, on the
Patent Roll, 7 Edw. VI., which may be inspected at the Public
Record Office, Rolls Chapel, on payment of a fee of 1<i>s.</i>,
with liberty to take a copy or extract in pencil gratuitously or a
plain copy may be obtained at the rate of 6<i>d.</i> a folio.</p>
<p>The act of 1 Mary, for the restitution in blood of the heirs of
Sir Miles Partrige, if not given in the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>{287}</span> large
edition of the Statutes, printed by the Record Commissioners, may
no doubt be seen at the Parliament Office, near the House of Lords,
on payment of the fee of 5<i>s.</i></p>
<p>I believe I am correct in saying that no debates of that session
are extant; but the proceedings on the various bills may probably
be traced in the journals of the two Houses of Parliament, which
are printed and deposited in most of our great public
libraries.</p>

<p><i>City Offices.</i>&mdash;The best account of the different
public offices of the city of London, with their duties, etc., that
I know of, your correspondent A CITIZEN (Vol. ii., p. 216.) will

Commissioners</i>.</p>
<p class="author">W.C.</p>
<p><i>Harvey and the Circulation of the Blood</i> (Vol. ii., p.
266.).&mdash;The claim set up on behalf of Father Paul to the
honour of Harvey's discovery, which is noticed by your
correspondent W.W.B., is satisfactorily disposed of in the life of
Harvey in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, iv. 2548., note C.
Harvey gave a copy of his treatise <i>De Motu Cordis</i> to the
Venetian ambassador in England. On his return home the ambassador
lent the book to Father Paul, who made some extracts from it. After
Father Paul's death, he was thought to be the author of these
extracts and hence the story which your correspondent quotes. It
might occasionally be convenient if your correspondents could make
<i>a little</i> inquiry before they send off their letters to
you.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>All who love the shady side of Pall Mall, and agree with Dr.
Johnson that the tide of human enjoyment flows higher at Charing
Cross than in any other part of the globe, will gladly welcome Mr.
Jesse's recently published volumes entitled <i>London and its
Celebrities</i>. They are pleasant, gossiping and suggestive, and
as the reader turns over page after page of the historical
recollections and personal anecdotes which are associated with the
various localities described by Mr. Jesse, he will doubtless be
well content to trust the accuracy of a guide whom he finds so
fluent and so intelligent, and approve rather than lament the
absence of those references to original authorities which are
looked for in graver histories. The work is written after the style
of Saint Foix' <i>Rues de Paris</i>, which Walpole once intended to
imitate; and is executed with a tact which will no doubt render it
very acceptable to those for whom it has been written, namely those
persons whose avocations of business or pleasure lead them to
traverse the thoroughfares of the great metropolis; and to whom it
points out in a manner which we have correctly designated
gossiping, pleasant, and suggestive, "such sites and edifices as
have been rendered classical by the romantic or literary
associations of past times."</p>
<p>Messrs. Williams and Norgate have forwarded to us a Catalog of
an extensive Collection of Books, the property of a distinguished
physician, which are to be sold by auction in Berlin on the 21st of
October. The library, which was forty years in forming, is
remarkable for containing, besides numerous rare works in Spanish,
Italian, French, and English Literature, a curious series of works
connected with the American aborigines; and a most extensive
collection of works on the subjects of Prison Discipline, Poor
Laws, and those other great social questions which are now exciting
such universal attention.</p>

<p>26. Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, Sept. 23, 1850.</p>
<p>At an ordinary meeting of the Central Committee of the
Arch&aelig;ological Institute, the President in the chair, it was
unanimously "Resolved&mdash;That the Committee, having taken into
consideration the Resolution of the British Arch&aelig;ological
Association, passed at their congress at Manchester, and also that
of their Council of the 4th of September, and communicated by the
President of the Association to the President of the Institute, are
of opinion that the position and prospects of the Institute are
such as to render inexpedient any essential modifications of it's
existing rules and managements.</p>
<p>"The Committee disclaim all unfriendly feeling towards the
Association: they are of opinion that the field of Arch&aelig;ology
is sufficiently wide for the operations of several societies
without discord; but if the members of the Arch&aelig;ological
Association should be disposed to unite with the Institute, the
Central Committee will cordially receive them on the terms
announced in their advertisement of September 9th, which was
intended to be conciliatory, feeling assured that such a course
cannot fail to meet with the entire approbation of the members of
the Institute."</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
